?1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,939
Do you know how
wrong it is to have a daughter

2
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:04,540
and simply choose not to
speak to her for eight years?

3
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:06,409
You think I wanted any of this to happen?

4
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:09,601
Grow some balls and go down
there and see your little girl.

5
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:10,625
Hey.

6
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:13,335
- I'm your father.
- It doesn't change the fact

7
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,932
that you walked out on your nine kids.

8
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,204
You had nine kids?

9
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:18,364
Seven. The twins weren't born yet.

10
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:20,426
- What's eating at you?
- I wouldn't tell you.

11
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:21,542
Oh, okay.

12
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:23,837
- Go throw with the guy.
- What? Why?

13
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:25,638
Come on. You'll get along great together.

14
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:28,107
Seems to me like you've lost somebody...

15
00:00:28,174 --> 00:00:30,045
Somebody you had feelings for.

16
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:31,460
You're good at what you do, Loudermilk.

17
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:32,456
Mm.

18
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:33,970
Think she bought it?

19
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,586
Meatballs are ready.

20
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:36,796
You paid this little asshole to talk to me.

21
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:39,162
- Nah.
- You tricked me again!

22
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,922
If it ain't broke...

23
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:58,226
I love that one, too.

24
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,134
It's called "Oil and Water."

25
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,769
'Cause that's a bag of oil
and that's a bag of water.

26
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,186
Neat.

27
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,969
There's an ironic sense of whimsy

28
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,791
in all of Shoreline's work.

29
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,041
This one explores the duality of conflict

30
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,061
that resides within the human psyche.

31
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:18,646
Don't you love when art does that?

32
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:19,697
Mm.

33
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,423
Unfortunately, this
piece has been purchased.

34
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,523
That is unfortunate...

35
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:27,928
for whoever bought it.

36
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,893
Honestly, I'd rather have
shit and piss on my wall.

37
00:01:32,476 --> 00:01:34,505
Come on, man. Enough with the snark.

38
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:36,111
You're ruining it for everyone.

39
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:38,294
No. I mean, right over there.

40
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,403
"Shit and Piss."

41
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,206
For the dining room, no?

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,258
Honey, let's get the fuck out of here.

43
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:53,093

44
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,569
All right, so, I told you
guys about my old band, right?

45
00:01:58,623 --> 00:01:59,558
No.

46
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:01,026
You managed a band?

47
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:02,360
No, I was in a band.

48
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:03,804
Back in the '90s.

49
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:05,769
What, uh, instrument did you play?

50
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:08,099
Drums.

51
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,801
Seriously, what instrument?

52
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,684
Really, I was the drummer.

53
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:14,840
What did you need, like,
extra-long sticks or something?

54
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:16,708
Hey, uh, quit breaking his balls.

55
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,376
No, I'm not breaking his balls.

56
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:21,847
I would think that you'd
need extra-long sticks,

57
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:24,322
'cause of the T. rex thing.

58
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:27,088
I just used regular,
18-inch, standard sticks.

59
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:29,013
What kind of music did you play?

60
00:02:29,013 --> 00:02:31,007
Oh, real rock 'n' roll.

61
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:33,150
Back in '96, we toured on a triple bill

62
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,685
with Dokken and Skid Row.

63
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:36,420
- Wow.
- We charted once.

64
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:38,022
- You guys had a hit?
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:40,459
- What was it called?
- "Boilerbreaker."

66
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:43,354
Well, isn't that Sauced Puppy?

67
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:44,385
Yeah.

68
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,024
You were in Sauced Puppy?

69
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:47,075
Yeah.

70
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:48,253
Wow!

71
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,061
You guys sucked.

72
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:52,245
No, no, no. I liked that song.

73
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:53,779
? Boilerbreaker ?

74
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:56,778
- Oh, God.
- ? Boilerbreaker ?

75
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,499
What's a boilerbreaker?

76
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:01,934
It's a modified boilermaker.

77
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,736
Our lead singer invented it.

78
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:06,205
You drop a double shot of
whiskey into a pint of beer.

79
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:07,805
So good.

80
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,824
So... so, tell us about
the groupies there, Roger.

81
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,361
You ever get one of them double blowjobs?

82
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:15,446
- You know, like, two dicks, one mouth?
- Heh.

83
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,631
Oh, my God. Check this out.

84
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:23,243
Okay. Can we let Roger
finish his share, please?

85
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,707
So, a couple of weeks ago,
our bass player called me,

86
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,042
and apparently, Sweeny's
Ale wants to use the band

87
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,082
in one of their commercials.

88
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,412
That's fucking awesome.

89
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:33,521
Well, back in the day,
it would've been awesome.

90
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,971
But where I am now in life,

91
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,323
I don't want to promote booze.

92
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:39,503
It's just beer.

93
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,927
Well, it's not just beer, though.

94
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:43,120
Brother Jay's Whiskey, and
now 'Cause Sweeny's bought out

95
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:45,656
they're making a drink that's
beer and whiskey combined.

96
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:47,191
Hey, Roger, why don't you
just let them use the song?

97
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:48,526
Who gives a fuck?

98
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,247
Guys, guys.

99
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,729
This is exactly the point

100
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:53,283
that I was trying to make earlier, okay?

101
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,238
You all have to make decisions

102
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,173
that are gonna make you
feel good about yourself.

103
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,841
So you think I'm doing the right thing

104
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,109
Turning down the 100 grand?

105
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:01,269
Absolutely...

106
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,742
How much?

107
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,870
100 grand.

108
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,388
Per guy.

109
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,710
For fucking "Boilerbreaker"?

110
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,884
Well, come on, man. Be straight with me.

111
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,030
What should I do?

112
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,220
Look, whatever you think, okay?

113
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,009
If you think you should
pass, you should pass.

114
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,960
Maybe you could come with me,

115
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,256
Help me explain it to the guys in the band.

116
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:21,421
Fuck, no.

117
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:23,246
Why should I be the one to tell them?

118
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,572
You're the one screwing them over.

119
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,266
But you just said it was
the right thing to do.

120
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,072
Yeah, well, it probably is, but, you know,

121
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,502
the thing about doing the right thing

122
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,504
is it usually pisses somebody off.

123
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,909
Come on, Loudermilk, please.
I really could use some help.

124
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,647
All right, let's, uh,
let's wrap this up, m'kay?

125
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,182
Good meeting, everybody.

126
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,653
You wanted to see me?

127
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,087
Yeah. Look, I like your daughter,

128
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:50,446
But you gotta get her off my couch.

129
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:52,397
Why? Is everything okay?

130
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:53,531
Did she relapse?

131
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:54,725
No, she's fine. She's doing fine.

132
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,258
Well, if she's doing fine,

133
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,494
Then we should stick with what's working.

134
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:01,131
No need to rock the boat, right?

135
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:02,193
No, no.

136
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:04,659
We need to rock the boat
until she falls off the boat

137
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:07,781
and swims to a couch on her own boat, okay?

138
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:10,943
I was happy to help her out,
but I got a life to get back to.

139
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,284
Not that I've seen.

140
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:15,080
What if I give you a thank-you gift

141
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:16,802
to show my appreciation?

142
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,110
Could she stay a little longer?

143
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:20,489
Wait! You're going to bribe him?

144
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:21,938
Stay out of this!

145
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:23,537
What'd you have in mind?

146
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:24,972
Well...

147
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,923
I could give you my husband's car.

148
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,583
It's just collecting
dust in the garage anyway.

149
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:34,057
He can't accept gifts over $25.

150
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:36,571
Says who? You're just making shit up now.

151
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,850
You're a drug-and-alcohol counselor.

152
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:41,583
Taking expensive gifts
from your group members

153
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,452
Or from their families is unethical.

154
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,320
It's the same for me as a man of the cloth.

155
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,461
Bullshit!

156
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:48,457
Like you paid for this place?

157
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:49,776
And what about the pope?

158
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:52,243
He's got a... custom-designed super Hummer.

159
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:54,369
You don't even have a license.
What would you do with a car?

160
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:55,967
He can sell it, for all I care.

161
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:57,769
I can sell it, for all she cares.

162
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,174
Yeah, I'll take the car.

163
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:01,876
And Claire can continue to stay with you?

164
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,146
Forgot there was a catch.

165
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:08,969
Yeah. For now.

166
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:12,020
I'll have someone bring
the vehicle by tomorrow.

167
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:13,021
Awesome.

168
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,276
Hey.

169
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,385
Hey!

170
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,168
What you watchin'?

171
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:29,040
It's, uh, "White Zombie."

172
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:33,108
Yeah, it's like "Walking
Dead," but really boring.

173
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,644
It's terrible. Sit down.

174
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:37,979
Tempting, but I think I'm
gonna go try and get some Z's

175
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:41,116
before snore-a-saurus
starts rattling the I-beams.

176
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:42,594
Look, I know I snore,

177
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:45,230
but it's like a sweet
little ladylike snore.

178
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:49,012
It's like a silverback fucking
a badger without its consent.

179
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,480
Okay, well, I slept
next to Wyatt for months,

180
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:52,973
and he didn't say a word.

181
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,323
He was on heroin.

182
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,121
He'd have slept through a kidney stone.

183
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:58,419
Okay, well, Ben hasn't said a word.

184
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:00,980
Well, I've always been a super sleeper...

185
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,177
Since I was a kid.

186
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:04,838
You're not a kid, so don't
say "super sleeper" again.

187
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:06,859
I think you have a medical condition, okay?

188
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,816
Oh, God.

189
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:09,984
I think you need one of those
machines that helps you breathe,

190
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:11,252
like Darth Vader has.

191
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,035
A CPAP. My dad had one.

192
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:15,256
Really? I'm that bad?

193
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:16,791
Yeah, you stop breathing for minutes.

194
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:18,392
It's like David Blaine-level shit.

195
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,222
I don't know how you
don't have brain damage.

196
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:21,903
Maybe I do.

197
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,974
Hey, I saw my mom's car in the parking lot.

198
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,743
What, was she checking up on me?

199
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,311
Well, you know, I think, in her mind,

200
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:30,302
you're on your own now.

201
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:32,582
Well, what'd she say?

202
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:34,050
Well, she's glad to hear you're doing well,

203
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:35,919
and she gave me your father's car.

204
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:38,721
What? Wait... Are you serious?

205
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:41,601
She gave you my dad's
Escalade? The car he died in?

206
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:42,873
What did you say?

207
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,394
Yeah, my dad died in that car.

208
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,862
No, no, no. The part... the part...

209
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,730
D-Did you say "Escalade"?

210
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,465
That's like a $90,000 truck.

211
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:52,148
Yeah, it's like $110,000 with
all the features he added.

212
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:54,404
No. No, no.

213
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,273
Your mom's not gonna give
me a brand-new Escalade.

214
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,014
What other cars did your dad have?

215
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,221
Uh, that's it.

216
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:02,000
I mean, she sold the Lincoln a while back.

217
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:03,280
That's the only car.

218
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:04,722
Actually perfect for you.

219
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:06,474
The new Escalades
practically drive themselves.

220
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,909
It's like KITT from "Knight Rider."

221
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:09,132
You won't even need a license.

222
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,612
Uh, yeah, you will need a license.

223
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,439
Oh, I won't need a license.
I'm not gonna drive it.

224
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:14,749
Probably just sell it.

225
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:15,773
What?!

226
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:18,041
You're gonna profit off
the car my dad died in?

227
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,777
He died in it?

228
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:22,040
I just told you that a minute ago!

229
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:23,041
No, you didn't.

230
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,659
What?! D... D...

231
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:25,727
Ben.

232
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,320
Uh... ah...

233
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,255
Pretty sure I would've remembered
you saying something like that.

234
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,072
You gonna let me drive
it before you sell it?

235
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:32,860
Yeah, if I get to ride shotgun.

236
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,259
Holy shit.

237
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:36,530
Um, I'm gonna try and get down

238
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:39,533
before the, you know, lumber
mill starts with the...

239
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,049
...lumber milling.

240
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:22,576
You're out of toilet paper again.

241
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:23,853
Again?

242
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,780
It's like you're single-handedly
clear-cutting the rainforest

243
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:28,115
with your asshole.

244
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:29,583
Oh, fuck off.

245
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,587
Hey, how was my snoring last night?

246
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,056
Awful. Terrible. Worse.

247
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:37,724
Well, I guess you'll just
have to start sleeping

248
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,393
in your fancy new car.

249
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,396
Yeah, or you have to get
one of those CPAP things.

250
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,998
Um, I would, but you need a prescription.

251
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:47,134
And when I was in boarding school,

252
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,869
no one would room with
me, so I looked into it.

253
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:51,719
Oh! So you know you have a problem.

254
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,170
Yeah, I do.

255
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,545
But... I don't know...

256
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,274
When I started doing coke,
I thought it went away.

257
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:59,554
Nope. Didn't go away.

258
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:01,500
Okay. Well...

259
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:04,550
Look, I'd go to the doctor,
but I don't have insurance,

260
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:05,804
so...

261
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:06,951
Sorry.

262
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,458
Hey. Sorry to bother you, but, uh,

263
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,019
I'm... fresh out of sugar.

264
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:18,983
Well, what do you need? Like,
a gram? An eight ball? Or...

265
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:27,073
Uh, is your Dr. McDreamy here?

266
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,031
No, he doesn't like to
stay over when he's on call.

267
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,005
He hates waking me up.

268
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:33,085
Okay.

269
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,801
Chivalrous.

270
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:36,682
He seems like an interesting guy.

271
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:38,084
I'd like to meet him.

272
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,827
You met him the other night.

273
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,925
Well, for two seconds.

274
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,187
I'd like to get to know
him, though, you know?

275
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:45,359
Uh...

276
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:47,160
We should all grab a meal sometime.

277
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,509
I'm meeting him at lunch today at Marty's.

278
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:50,496
Do you want to join us?

279
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:51,656
Yeah. That'll work.

280
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:53,491
Okay. Well, here you go.

281
00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:54,656
Ah.

282
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:56,684
Better not be stepping on this shit, huh?

283
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,396
This thing drives like a dream.

284
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,395
It's pretty fucking sweet, right?

285
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,815
Man. Smell the leather.

286
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,278
I think this is what Dubai smells like.

287
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:12,273
It's an impressive gift.

288
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,580
Yeah. You should check out the
bowling alley I got in back.

289
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:19,615
Seriously, the Blue Book
value on this thing is insane.

290
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:21,917
This is the place.

291
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:24,581
We're meeting them at a car wash?

292
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,196
Yeah. They work there.

293
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,991
What's up? Billy.

294
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:38,210
Holy shit!

295
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,520
Roger-Dodger!

296
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:42,989
Is this your car?

297
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:44,324
No. No, it's his.

298
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,992
Hi. It's my car.

299
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,188
- Hey.
- Hey.

300
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,981
Hey, um, thanks for coming down
to talk this out face-to-face.

301
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:54,228
I know things got a little
heated on the text thread.

302
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:55,219
No problem.

303
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,440
Where's Maggie?

304
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,475
Uh, he's right over there.

305
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,277
Yo! Mags!

306
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,077
Hey.

307
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,379
Who's this fuck?

308
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:07,923
You lawyer up on us?

309
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:10,249
No. This is Loudermilk. He's a friend.

310
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:11,563
Pleasure.

311
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:13,090
Hey.

312
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:14,435
All right, then.

313
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,497
- Should we, uh, talk business?
- Yeah.

314
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:19,835
Not here. We're supposed to be working.

315
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:21,281
Pull inside.

316
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,615
Oh. Okay.

317
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,802
Make sure it's in neutral.

318
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:30,868
Yeah, okay.

319
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:32,453
Okay. Bring out the contract.

320
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:34,088
Show him where to sign.

321
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,524
I already told you guys.
I'm not gonna sign that.

322
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:39,744
I came here today as a courtesy
to you both to explain why.

323
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:42,071
D-Do you know what?

324
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,731
- Oh, Christ!
- Mags, what are you doing?

325
00:12:43,798 --> 00:12:45,266
I'm getting this guy to
sign the fucking papers

326
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,615
one way or another.

327
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,416
Dude, relax, all right? Nobody nee...

328
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:50,918
The fuck kinda gun is that?

329
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:52,565
You got a problem with it?!

330
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:54,024
No. No, no. Hey, look.

331
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:56,442
I'm not here for a musket
ball to the head, all right?

332
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,981
I'm just supporting my friend Roger.

333
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,901
This is just like Wichita all over again.

334
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,967
You didn't shoot then, and
you're not gonna shoot now.

335
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:08,588
Don't tempt me, Roger.

336
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:12,177
My life is shit right now, and
I have nothing to lose, okay?

337
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:14,846
And I'm really sorry about that,
but I'm still not gonna sign.

338
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:18,184
Are we sure this is not gonna
scratch the finish? 'Cause...

339
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:20,764
Help me understand where
your head's at here, Roger.

340
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,442
I mean, what is wrong with us

341
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,244
making a little bit of money off our art?

342
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,320
They want our song to
promote binge drinking

343
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:28,147
and having sex with passed-out women.

344
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:29,903
Blacked-out women!

345
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:31,497
It's a big difference.

346
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,352
What? What is the difference?

347
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:36,127
How are we gonna know if
they're blacked out, Roger?!

348
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:38,162
They're walking and
talking Like everyone else!

349
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:39,158
Yeah!

350
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:41,293
Put the fucking gun down, Maggie.

351
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:44,728
Just...

352
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,099
Oh, for fuck's sake!

353
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:48,881
Come on, Roger!

354
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,009
Please?!

355
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,020
This commercial could
get me back on my feet...

356
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,257
maybe open a little pizza joint.

357
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,063
The residuals alone will
get me off my cousin's couch.

358
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:58,551
You get residuals?

359
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,019
Fuck, yeah!

360
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,554
It'll double what we get paid.

361
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,875
We could make 200 grand... Each!

362
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,893
That's a lot of money, Roger.

363
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,032
I know.

364
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,710
But it doesn't matter.

365
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,332
Dude, you're the real deal, you know?

366
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,170
I mean, you may die broke,
but you're rich with integrity.

367
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,640
Shut the fuck up, you fucking hypocrite!

368
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:23,509
Driving up in here with
your fancy fucking Esplanade,

369
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,177
telling Roger to turn
down money that he needs!

370
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:26,178
Roger...

371
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,513
Ow! Fuck.

372
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,181
Don't listen to this dick!

373
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,964
Listen to your friends.

374
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,386
You could have your own Esplanade.

375
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,788
All right, first off, it's a
fucking Escalade, all right?

376
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:38,330
And I didn't do anything
for this. It was a gift.

377
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,428
Hey, you're the one who's always going on

378
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,795
saying no gift comes
without strings attached...

379
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:45,901
Except the gift you give yourself.

380
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,370
I didn't say that. You saw that
on a cat calendar or something.

381
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,333
Nobody's perfect, Rog.

382
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:52,436
Come on.

383
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,148
Just... bend...

384
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,203
a little.

385
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:03,459
Fuck it!

386
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,195
And so when I got the residency,

387
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,996
I asked Allie to move to Seattle,

388
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,265
And, lucky for me, she said yes.

389
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,801
And, lucky for me, I
was able to find a sublet

390
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,803
in your apartment building on short notice.

391
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,939
Yeah, I wouldn't call anyone
lucky in that building.

392
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:24,998
It's like...

393
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,444
a big pile of asbestos held
together with lead paint.

394
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,947
So, what about work? What'd they say?

395
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:34,115
Well, they weren't very
happy, but, luckily,

396
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,517
Sotheby's has offices everywhere, so...

397
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:38,105
So it all worked out.

398
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:39,818
Yeah.

399
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,443
Aw.

400
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:44,687
So, how come you two don't
actually live together?

401
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:48,627
Oh, you know, um... my hours
are so unpredictable, so...

402
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:52,030
Well, and... and we
practically do live together.

403
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:53,965
It's just like he said...

404
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:57,302
With the crazy timing
and me and my new job.

405
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,070
- Right.
- It... it just...

406
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,438
Right. Right, right, right, right, right.

407
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:02,442
So, hey, Dr. Carl...

408
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,418
uh... I'm sure you hate it

409
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:07,753
when people ask you
for free medical advice,

410
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,197
but this isn't about me.

411
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:10,732
It's about the dirty little drug fiend

412
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,523
who's sleeping on my couch.

413
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:16,092
Okay, um... What's the problem?

414
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:20,275
She's got this, uh,
deviated-septum, sleep-apnea,

415
00:16:20,342 --> 00:16:23,812
possible demon-living-in-
the-throat situation,

416
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,709
and the snoring is just...

417
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:27,723
it's nuts.

418
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,690
I think she could really use
one of those CPAP machines.

419
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,056
'Cause those work, right?

420
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:34,526
Well, yeah.

421
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,327
Yeah, but she should see a doctor,

422
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:38,229
find out what's causing the problem.

423
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:40,331
Well, I got a doctor
sitting right across from me.

424
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:41,766
Yeah, a sleep specialist.

425
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,177
Yeah, that's not a real thing.

426
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:46,146
Here. Listen. This is her.

427
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,120
I made this recording
last night, okay? Listen.

428
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:57,347
Wow.

429
00:16:58,074 --> 00:16:59,559
Yeah? Listen to this.

430
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,304
She quits breathing for
2 minutes and 36 seconds.

431
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,397
All right? Another time,
it's closer to four minutes,

432
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,634
but I-I-I just didn't have
the phone handy to document it.

433
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,524
Well, I can see why that would worry you.

434
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,910
Oh, I'm not worried. I just
want to get some sleep at night.

435
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:21,576
I need to use the ladies' room.

436
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:22,910
Yeah. Sure.

437
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,849
Look, I can't just grab you a CPAP machine.

438
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,385
That's not how it works. There
are rules and regulations.

439
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:33,254
Come on, you gotta have,
like, a crappy old used one

440
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,523
Laying around somewhere, right?

441
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:38,362
Missing some knobs or it's a little moldy.

442
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:40,208
Yeah?

443
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:44,866
I think that guy's choking.

444
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,003
Uh...

445
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,005
Dr. Carl!

446
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,231
Hey...

447
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:54,785
Fuck's sake.

448
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,148
Guhh!

449
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:13,431
Dude, you... You gotta remember to chew.

450
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,405
What happened?

451
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:17,462
This guy just saved my life.

452
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:18,599
He was choking.

453
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,599
Oh, honey.

454
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,336
Not him.

455
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:26,259
Him.

456
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,087
What? Loudermilk?

457
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,277
Hey, how is that? I almost ordered that.

458
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,866
It's...

459
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:39,226
- ...fine. Fine. Yeah.
- No? All right.

460
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,828
Look, the guy had it under control, okay?

461
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,163
He didn't need my help.

462
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:52,597
Nobody's saying otherwise.

463
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,714
Well, you're both sitting there judging me

464
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:56,394
for not doing anything. I can feel it.

465
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:57,705
Thing is, I was doing something.

466
00:18:57,838 --> 00:18:59,675
I was assessing the situation,

467
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,347
waiting to see if I was needed.

468
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:04,229
- Really?
-The guy was working it out on his own.

469
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,985
Yeah. Maybe.

470
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,094
Nope... definitely.

471
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:09,845
No... maybe.

472
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:11,527
By way of "probably not."

473
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,697
Will you stop it? The guy was fine.

474
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,528
How come his face was turning blue?

475
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:16,966
It wasn't turning blue.

476
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,301
It was flush... From coughing.

477
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:20,695
He didn't cough.

478
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:23,164
He couldn't cough. He grunted.

479
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,172
Cough...

480
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:27,837
Grunt...

481
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,067
- It's a big difference.
- Right.

482
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,436
Look, guys, the guy is fine.
That's all that matters.

483
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:35,683
Yeah, why don't you stop
trying to be a hero, Loudermilk?

484
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,631
Hey, I'm not a hero.

485
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:39,666
I just did what anyone
would do in that situation.

486
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,935
Right, except me.

487
00:19:40,936 --> 00:19:44,073
The only one in the room who
studied medicine for seven years

488
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,456
and knows exactly how to
react in that situation.

489
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,070
Carl, come on. Just admit
it. You fucking choked, okay?

490
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:52,117
He choked, and then you choked.

491
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:53,591
It's all right. Nobody's perfect.

492
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,792
I work in an ER. I don't choke.

493
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:58,162
I have ice water in my veins.

494
00:19:58,229 --> 00:19:59,635
Well, I'm sure you do...

495
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:01,170
In the safe confines of the operating room,

496
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,663
where there's a whole bunch of
other doctors and nurses around

497
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,800
when something goes wrong.

498
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:06,601
Look... Okay.

499
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:09,805
There's other factors to
consider here, Loudermilk, okay?

500
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:12,714
Doctors have to be very
cautious when administering aid.

501
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,079
We can get sued.

502
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:15,984
- O... kay.
- Happens all the time.

503
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:17,167
Let's just drop it.

504
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,574
I didn't bring it up. He did.

505
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,143
Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Can I get the check?

506
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,058
No need for that. Your meal's
been comped by management.

507
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,006
It's the least we could do.

508
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:29,385
Oh.

509
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,551
Great.

510
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:32,997
That's very generous.

511
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,890
You get the tip.

512
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:39,230
It goes to 5, but never
turn a CPAP up to 5.

513
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:41,562
My dad did that once... He
blew up to twice his size.

514
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:43,730
He was floating around
the room. It was awful.

515
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,195
My mom woke up in the morning,

516
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:48,264
and she had to hit him with,
like, a needle to pop him,

517
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:50,303
and then at breakfast, he
farted for eight minutes.

518
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:51,729
Holy shit. Is that what I think it is?

519
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:55,392
Yeah, it's a CPAP, and
Carl brought it over.

520
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,306
Pretty nice of the good
doctor, don't you think?

521
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,595
No, I think he just did
it 'cause he felt guilty.

522
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:02,531
Uh, why? Because he's sleeping
with your imaginary girlfriend?

523
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,669
No, we were having lunch,
and some guy started choking.

524
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:08,338
Okay, and Dr. Carl just
sits there looking at him

525
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,207
like he's a turd on a log.

526
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:11,575
Wait... So what happened?

527
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Yeah, did the fucking guy die?

528
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,345
No, no, he didn't die, but only because

529
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:18,215
I had to jump up and save him, you know?

530
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:20,684
Like, I've got a doctor
sitting right across from me.

531
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:23,020
I've never even taken the
damn class, and here I am...

532
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:25,689
I get up and I'm giving
him the Heimlich maneuver.

533
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,824
So I guess he got Heimlock.

534
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:30,154
You just make that up?

535
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:31,849
Yeah, it's when you're gonna
give the Heimlich Maneuver,

536
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:33,345
but then you freeze up, so it's Heimlock.

537
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:35,548
No? All right, well, they
can't all be slam dunks.

538
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:37,683
I'm starting to think Dr.
Carl's not even a real doctor.

539
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,485
Oh, what are you even complaining for?

540
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:41,754
You got to look like a hero
in front of your lady friend

541
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:43,222
And then we got a CPAP machine.

542
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:44,742
It's true.

543
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:46,376
- That goes in your nose.
- I know.

544
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:47,724
Do I look sexy?

545
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:50,827
If I'm an elephant.

546
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:53,453
Wait... Are you saying I'm fat?

547
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:55,717
- No, he's talking about your ears.
- Hey.

548
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:20,967
I feel like a fucking moron in this getup.

549
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:23,352
No, y-you look like Andre Agassi.

550
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:25,224
You need anything?

551
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:28,312
Yeah, can you grab me a Coke?
I've got to drink something.

552
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:29,382
You got it.

553
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:35,524
Are you an idiot? How could
you not know about this?

554
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:37,659
They never had a video. How would I know?

555
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:38,876
Jesus Christ.

556
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:40,454
How does he even play the drums?

557
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:42,547
I... With his feet, maybe?

558
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:43,901
This is fucked up.

559
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:45,721
We have to replace this guy ASAP.

560
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,500
He's a poster child for
fetal alcohol syndrome.

561
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:50,420
I mean, what's our messaging here...

562
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,022
If you drink Sweeny's, you become deformed?

563
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,323
- Is that our messaging?
- Okay, okay, okay.

564
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:54,403
What am I supposed to do?

565
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,604
Just get rid of him!

566
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:56,941
All right.

567
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:58,665
Hey. Roger, come here.

568
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,795
Listen...

569
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,299
how bad do you want this thing?

570
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:04,279
What do you mean?

571
00:23:04,304 --> 00:23:05,525
This commercial.

572
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:10,614
I don't want it at all.

573
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,357
But I can't let them down.

574
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,685
Why? He fucking pulled a gun on you.

575
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:16,084
That's just Maggie.

576
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:17,692
Forget him. Just...

577
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:20,059
If you don't want to
do it, man, don't do it.

578
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:21,895
Period. End of story.

579
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:23,897
If it's not what you're all about...

580
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,406
I mean, I get it... It's a big paycheck.

581
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,915
I get that, okay?

582
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,343
I got an Escalade somebody handed me,

583
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,245
and I probably shouldn't keep that.

584
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:36,003
I definitely shouldn't keep that.

585
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,618
'Cause it makes me a sellout.

586
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,140
Understand?

587
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:41,689
Do I want to be a sellout

588
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:45,600
for an awesome, tricked-out, luxury SUV?

589
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,568
Hey, Rog? Can I get a
word with you, please?

590
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:51,220
Not now. We're gonna
do a quick sound check.

591
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:52,380
Just the first verse.

592
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,881
Sound check, everybody! Let's go!

593
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:54,949
Sound check!

594
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,560
One, two, three, four!

595
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,565
? Boilerbreaker, boilerbreaker ?

596
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:13,568
? Take it all in ?

597
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:17,372
? It's only time till you make her ?

598
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:19,707
? Body's built for sin ?

599
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:22,110
Owwwww!

600
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,594
Are you fucking shitting me?

601
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,819
This guy's incredible!

602
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:42,484
This shit could go viral.

603
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:43,931
Yeah!

604
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,425
Boom!

605
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,481
Yeah!

606
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:53,397
Oh, that was some wicked shit, my man!

607
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:55,466
Let's get out of here.

608
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:56,628
Yeah?

609
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,714
To take the car for one
last high-speed drive

610
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:00,177
before you give it back.

611
00:25:00,228 --> 00:25:01,729
Did I say I was giving it back?

612
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,999
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Rog! Where you going?

613
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:06,559
Sorry, guys.

614
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:08,361
- I'm done.
- What?

615
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:10,380
He's out. He's not doing your commercial.

616
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,032
Hey, we have a contract!

617
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:13,366
Fuck you!

618
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:21,374
Hey. What's this still doing here?

619
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:22,842
I thought you said you
were gonna give it back.

620
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:24,359
I did give it back.

621
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:25,581
Boys.

622
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:29,923
Are you fucking kidding me?

623
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,717
She gave this to you?

624
00:25:32,426 --> 00:25:33,544
Yep.

625
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:36,754
What about all that shit about
you don't take expensive gifts?

626
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,925
Well, you remember your
pope/Hummer argument?

627
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:42,104
Well, it carried a lot of weight with me.

628
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,968
I was told I could find
a Sam Loudermilk here?

629
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:53,191
Yeah, that's me.

630
00:25:53,215 --> 00:25:55,271
Meeting's in there. It
starts in 10 minutes.

631
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,468
I'm not here for a meeting.

632
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,613
- You're being sued.
- For what?

633
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:04,373
For breaking my client's ribs
while recklessly administering

634
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,622
The Heimlich maneuver
when it wasn't needed.

635
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,520
Motherfucker.

636
00:26:10,545 --> 00:26:12,447
You know, if you hadn't taken
that, you couldn't get sued.

637
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:13,782
Shut the fuck up.

638
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:14,933
I'm just trying to help.
