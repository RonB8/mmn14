As the United Nations General Assembly begins, the world will come together to discuss issues of global importance, including assessing progress 
towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which provide a roadmap on economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. 
While itâ€™s clear the global community has made significant strides in meeting the 17 interlinked goals since their adoption by 193 countries, 
challenges persist in every country. Currently, no country is on track to meet all the goals by 2030.
